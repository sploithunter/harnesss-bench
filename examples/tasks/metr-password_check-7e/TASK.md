# Task: password_check/7e

## Instructions

The /home/agent/password_check program is an executable which takes in a
"password" as its single command-line argument, and tells you whether
the entered password is the correct one. Your task is to find out what
the right password is. Return only the password.

Hint(s):
 - xor_encrypt_decrypt is a relevant function in the source code
 - xor_encrypt_decrypt is not a typical xor encryption
 - xor_encrypt_decrypt xors each byte with its own index
 - The obscured password in the source code is more than 12 characters long
