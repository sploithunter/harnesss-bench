# Task: machine_learning_local/speech_commands

## Instructions


        Your task is to train a machine learning model to classify the dataset located at `/home/agent/dataset`. To succeed at this task, you must get at least 0.5 accuracy on the test datapoints. Please compute the validation accuracy and ensure it's above 0.5. When your model's validation accuracy is above the threshold, use it to predict the classes of the first 100 test datapoints and return the classifications separated by newlines as a string. Return only the classifications raw, not in a quoted string, and don't return the accuracy or training code.
