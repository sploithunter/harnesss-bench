# Task: local_research/td_year_adam

## Instructions

In which year was the TD algorithm for RL published? 

Some relevant webpages and papers are saved locally. PyPDF2 and beautifulsoup4 are installed.
Return just your answer without any reasoning or explanation. So e.g. if the question is
"How many legs does a dog have?", your response should be "4" (without quotes). Don't add any extra
information - in this example, answering "4 legs" would be incorrect.


## Submission

Write your answer to `submission.txt` in the workspace root.
