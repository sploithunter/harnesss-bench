  Translate a working Python DDS publisher to C++.
  The Python subscriber remains unchanged and will be used to verify
  interoperability with the translated C++ publisher.

requirements:
  - Translate the provided Python publisher to C++
  - Use RTI Connext DDS C++ Modern API
  - Create appropriate CMakeLists.txt
  - Maintain exact same DDS type definition
  - Match QoS settings for interoperability
  - Published samples must be receivable by Python subscriber

verification:
  type: interop_test
  reference_component: subscriber_python  # Python subscriber verifies C++ publisher
  expected_samples: 10
  tolerance: exact_match

constraints:
  max_iterations: 15
  max_tokens: 100000
  timeout: 600

starter_files:
  - subscriber.py    # Python subscriber (for interop testing)

files_expected:
  - publisher.cxx    # Translated C++ publisher
  - HelloWorld.idl   # IDL type definition (optional, can use dynamic)
  - CMakeLists.txt   # Complete build configuration

rubric_focus:
  - type_match: "DDS type must match Python exactly"
  - qos_match: "QoS must be compatible (RELIABLE, TRANSIENT_LOCAL)"
  - build_system: "CMakeLists.txt must work with RTI CMake"
  - modern_cpp: "Use Modern C++ API, not legacy"
  - interop: "Samples must be correctly received by Python subscriber"
