description: |
  Complete workflow using rtiddsgen to generate type support from IDL.
  This is how most production DDS systems are built.

  Tests understanding of:
  - IDL syntax
  - rtiddsgen tool usage
  - Using generated Python types
  - Difference from DynamicData approach

workflow:
  1. Write IDL file defining types
  2. Run rtiddsgen to generate Python type support
  3. Create publisher using generated types
  4. Create subscriber using generated types
  5. Verify interoperability

requirements:
  - Write correct IDL file (HelloWorld.idl)
  - Run rtiddsgen with correct options for Python
  - Import and use generated type support
  - Publisher and subscriber must interoperate

verification:
  type: end_to_end
  method: publisher_subscriber_pair
  expected_samples: 10

constraints:
  max_iterations: 20
  max_tokens: 100000
  timeout: 600

files_expected:
  - HelloWorld.idl
  - publisher.py  (uses generated types)
  - subscriber.py (uses generated types)

rubric_focus:
  - idl_syntax: "Correct IDL syntax"
  - rtiddsgen_usage: "Correct tool invocation"
  - generated_imports: "Proper import of generated modules"
  - type_usage: "Correct usage of generated type API"
