description: |
  Create a DDS publisher in C++ from scratch.
  NO Python source code is provided - only the type specification
  and requirements. Tests true C++ DDS expertise.

requirements:
  - Create C++ publisher for "HelloWorld" topic
  - Use RTI Connext DDS Modern C++ API
  - Match exact type specification (see below)
  - Use specified QoS for interoperability
  - Create CMakeLists.txt for building

type_specification:
  name: HelloWorld
  members:
    - name: message
      type: string
      max_length: 256
    - name: count  
      type: int32

qos_requirements:
  reliability: RELIABLE
  durability: TRANSIENT_LOCAL
  history: KEEP_ALL

verification:
  type: interop_test
  reference_component: subscriber_python
  expected_samples: 10
  tolerance: exact_match

constraints:
  max_iterations: 20
  max_tokens: 150000
  timeout: 900

files_provided:
  - NONE (only this specification)

files_expected:
  - publisher.cxx
  - HelloWorld.idl
  - CMakeLists.txt

rubric_focus:
  - api_correctness: "Correct use of Modern C++ DDS API"
  - type_definition: "IDL matches specification exactly"
  - build_system: "CMakeLists.txt works with RTI CMake"
  - qos_settings: "QoS compatible with Python subscriber"
  - code_quality: "Clean, idiomatic C++ code"
