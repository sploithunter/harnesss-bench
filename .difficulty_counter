=== TEST DESIGN PRINCIPLE ===
FAIR TO SHARE:
- Data models (IDL, XML type definitions)
- Root library imports (rti.connextdds)
- What the output should look like

NOT FAIR TO SHARE:
- API code patterns
- How to create entities (Requester, DataReader, etc.)
- QoS setup code
- WaitSet patterns
- Any code that models can copy-paste

=== LR-01 RPC TEST RESULTS ===
Before (with code examples):
- 1 iteration, 34s, $0.19
- Essentially copy-paste

After (without code examples):
- 2 iterations, 207s, $0.96
- Model had to figure out rti.rpc API
- Failed first attempt (0/4), fixed on retry

IMPROVEMENT: 6x longer, 5x more expensive, required iteration

=== UPDATED TEST FILES ===
- LR-01_dds_rpc_request_reply/TASK.md - stripped code examples
- LN-C-01_native_c_subscriber/TASK.md - stripped CMake and C API examples
- LN-CPP-02_native_cpp_subscriber/TASK.md - stripped CMake and C++ API examples

=== NEXT STEPS ===
1. Re-test C and C++ tasks with stripped TASK.md
2. Consider adding IDL file as starter file (since data model is fair to share)
3. Create more tests using this principle
